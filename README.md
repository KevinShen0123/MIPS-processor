<h1>Design implementation</h1>
<li>Step 1: Initializing Imem and Dmem using mif file generated by .s file. </li>
<li>Step 2: Wrote clock divider, assigning it to regfile and pc</li>
<li>Step 3: In processor, compelete datapath, add Imem, Dmem,alu, sign extention, pc</li>
<li>Step 4: Modified skeleton, set all the signals as output to run testbenches</li>
<h1>bugs or issues</h1>
We used testbench to see the output of each signals. From our point of view, all the signals behaved as expected, no bugs or issue were found.

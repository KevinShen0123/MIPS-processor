## Design implementation 
For this project checkpoint, our goal is to implement a simple processor that can support simple R type and I type ,J type, JI type, JII type .instructions, We mainly modified processor.v ,we used our own regfile and alu modules and integrate them into the whole project. And we use imem.v and dmem.v as memory generation files. For processor.v, we follow the knowledge learned in class to divide the instructions into necessary parts, and complete each instructions as required for this assignment.
## Bugs and issues
All componets seem working well so far, testbench is passed without error.
